I have extremely varied musical tastes. I can listen to almost any genre and find at least one album I like. However, when I’m doing a stretch of programming for a project, I find it helps to listen to music that draws the attention toward the code.

Here are 14 albums that put my mind in the zone when I program. Most of these albums are readily available on Apple Music or Spotify, and some are from my own (pre-streaming service) collection.

1. **Heartbeat Radio** – Sondre Lerche
2. **So Far Tonight** – Lia Pamina and Dario Persi
3. **Black Holes & Revelations** – Muse
4. **Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino** – Arctic Monkeys
5. **Odelay** – Beck
6. **Out of Limits!**– The Marketts
7. **Spilt Milk** – Jellyfish
8. **Chopin Nocturnes, vol. 1** – Idil Biret
9. **Phantom Planet is Missing** – Phantom Planet
10. **Clara Obscura** – The Relationship
11. **Simply Baroque** – Yo-Yo Ma & Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra
12. **Please** – Sondre Lerche
13. **This Euphoria** – Davíd Garza
14. **Rainbows & Robots** – DJ Me DJ You
