“The Laws of Simplicity” by John Maeda was a book I’ve had on my to-read list for some time. I’m thrilled to have finally gotten around to reading it!

Written in 2006, the entire book is very forward thinking, however I found chapter 8 especially prophetic. Without giving anything away, I’ll just say that it suggests we will start trusting governments and private companies with our personal data in exchange for convenience.

In this book, Maeda provides a quick, light read filled with clever acronyms and parables. It’s a must read for any product manager or designer.
